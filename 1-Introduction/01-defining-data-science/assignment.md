# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools? | Student's grade sorted by level, and also linked to the respective subject and, if available the method used to teaching the students for each subject. | Structure the data and store it in a database. | We can compare the student's grade and the method used to theaching the students. We also compare the method with the student's age. |
| Vaccination | How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic? | We can collect public data from health gov division, speacially data of vaccination numbers, with information about the region of these people, age and social conditions | Structure the data and store it in a database. | The amount of vaccine applied, the regions with its vaccination numbers. The most vaccinated region of the country. The most age people vaccinated. |
| Productivity | How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work? | Projects done. Number of e-mails replyed per day. Number of ticket resolved omn the portal. | Tructured the data and store it in spreadsheet or in a local database. | Number of projects completed per month, the amount of tickets resolved per day. |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
